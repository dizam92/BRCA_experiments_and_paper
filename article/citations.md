Lien présentant la différenciation entre les différents types de notations STage vs TNM staging system:
1. Les différents stage sont expliqué et evidemment plus 0 means nothing and 4 means the worst
2. TNM system:
	1. T (size) category describes the original (primary) tumor
	2. N (lymph node involvement) category describes whether or not the cancer has reached nearby lymph nodes
	3. M (metastasis) category tells whether or not there is evidence that the cancer has traveled to other parts of the body

Really explain what TN is!
1. Triple-negative breast cancer is cancer that tests negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and excess HER2 protein. These results mean the growth of the cancer is not fueled by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, or by the HER2 protein. So, triple-negative breast cancer does not respond to hormonal therapy medicines or medicines that target HER2 protein receptors. Still, other medicines are used to successfully treat triple-negative breast cancer
2. About 10-20% of breast cancers are triple-negative breast cancers. For doctors and researchers, there is intense interest in finding new medications that can treat this kind of breast cancer. Studies are trying to find out whether certain medications can interfere with the processes that cause triple-negative breast cancer to grow.
3. About 10-20% of breast cancers test negative for both hormone receptors and excess HER2 in the lab, which means they are triple-negative. Since hormones aren’t fueling the cancer’s growth, the cancer is unlikely to respond to hormonal therapy medicines, including tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Triple-negative breast cancer also is unlikely to respond to medicines that target the HER2 protein, such as Herceptin (chemical name: trastuzumab), Kadcyla (chemical name: T-DMA or ado-trastuzumab emtansine), Nerlynx (chemical name: neratinib), Perjeta (chemical name: pertuzumab), or Tykerb (chemical name: lapatinib).
4. __Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur (come back) after treatment.__: Peut on induire le TN basé sur la présence de mestatse M3?
5. It tends to be higher grade than other types of breast cancer. The higher the grade, the less the cancer cells resemble normal, healthy breast cells in their appearance and growth patterns. __On a scale of 1 to 3, triple-negative breast cancer often is grade 3.__: Oh donc si j'ai un stage >=3 et les informations sont pas available je peux dire TN? 
6. __IMPORTANT DE TJRS DISSOCIER__: It usually is a cell type called “basal-like.” “Basal-like” means that the cells resemble the basal cells that line the breast ducts. Basal-like cancers tend to be more aggressive, higher grade cancers — just like triple-negative breast cancers. Most but not all basal-like breast cancers are triple negative, and most but not all triple-negative breast cancers are basal-like.
7. Who gets triple-negative breast cancer?: Jeune (- 60 ans), balck and hispanic woman, mutation BRCA1
8. Treatment for triple-negative breast cancer: __Neoadjuvant chemotherapy__; __PARP inhibitors__; __Immunotherapy__
