Abstract
--------
1. Introduce the application of ML to bioinformatic data and specialy breastcancer
2. MultiOmics
2. SCM and DT and results overviews()

Introduction
------------
1. Extends the abstract essentially 
2. The idea to sell here is: 
    1. Alone each view are not sufficent to produce a meaningful biologic explanation
    2. We apply 3 algorithms but the scm give us the sparse one and the most important one
    3. Biologic Explanation about the features we see
    4. Introduce the pyscmGroup? (it didnt work as i planned)

Material and Methods
--------------------
1. Datasets (See dataset_preprocessing.md)
2. Advantages of the algorithms: 
3. Run 15 times to avoid randomness: best results were reported
4. Talk about the HPs?
5. Talk about the different views combinations: Sometimes we didn't have the clinical and SNP but it didn't influence the results anyway)

Results
-------
1. Present the score
2. Present a biological analysis of the best results

Future Works
------------
I really don't know here
Maybe here open on the scm group idea(but am i not be open to be robbed of the idea)


- reponderation negative des poids pour le pyscmGroup 
- Voir pathways appartenance dans resultats random forest
